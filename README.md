# WAT
Scrivener has this cool feature where it can combine multiple documents in a directory or series of subdirectories and output in a variety of formats. I want to try and replicate that, more or less, since I can't run Scrivener on my POS samsung arm chromebook.

# WHEN?!
I forgot completely I wanted to do this but it seemed like a really cool idea so I may start working on this again ASAP.
